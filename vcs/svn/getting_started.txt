STEP 1: Create a repository

STEP 2: Import working projecct

First, make sure that your project structure is as follows

/tmp/
   myproject/
      branches/
      tags/
      trunk/
         foo.c
         bar.c
         Makefile
         â€¦

Now run svn import to copy the files into the repository.  You have to specify the path to the repository using a URL.  Additional information about repository urls is contained in eponymous file.

Ex. local repository
$ svn import /tmp/myproject file:///var/svn/repos/myproject \
      -m "initial import"
