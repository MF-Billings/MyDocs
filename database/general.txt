- a general rule of thumb for indexing is to index any fields that will be used in joins or WHERE

- to update fields in a logical table that consists of multiple tables you can join them as you would in a select query //untested

- performing queries within a loop creates substantial overhead due in part to the constants DB reconnects between queries

- some subqueries can kill performance with even small datasets.

// --------------------------------------------------------------

- FULL JOINs are not supported.  To obtain the same effect you can use union with left and right joins

Select members of a logical group with the largest date w/n group

left join the table onto itself using the column(s) you're grouping on in the ON clause of the join and adding table1.date > table2.date WHERE table1.date IS NULL andd any other optional filters
