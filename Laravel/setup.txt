Obstacle 1) Loading the public page for my first app threw the following error:

UnexpectedValueException:
The stream or file "/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/laravel/storage/logs/laravel.log" could not be opened: failed to open stream: Permission denied

Solution was to run 'sudo chmod -R 777 storage/*' from within the root of the application's folder.
